# Project Code
You can find the code we write.

### Data Preprocessing
We use Google colab to make video and split the data.
1. Make different color type of video. 
    - [Original video to black and white video](/MakeGrayVideo.ipynb)
    - [Original video to high saturation video](/MakeHSVVideo.ipynb)
2. Split video to images.
    - [Split video as frame and save](/train_test_split.ipynb)

### Model
We used three type of pre-trained model : VGGFace2, ResNet50, DenseNet121.
- [VGGFace2](/vggface2.py)
- [ResNet50](/resnet50.py)
- [DenseNet121](/densenet121.py)
