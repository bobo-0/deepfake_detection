# Deepfake Detection Project
- This repository contains all codes for Deepfake Detection Project (2022 Spring semester, Neural Networks and Deep Learning)
- Team mates : Yebin Lee, Juhyeon Jung

## Main Idea
This project is aiming to investigate the effect of image change on Deepfake detection problem. Deepfake detection performance is compared using original (color) image, images with color changes, and images with changes in saturation.
